# Inspiration

Our inspiration came from wanting to help provide a more accessible option to manage device security, for anyone who doesn't understand tech, or can't easily see or view settings.

# What it does

Our app is designed, so it not only helps to protect users' devices, but also helps them easily manage these settings. Our app uses registry keys for Windows, to help manage settings for different Windows Defender functions. This then allows the user to easily enable these settings, so that they can protect themselves from harmful software. The app also allows you to store notes, in a password protected file, and helps to keep device passwords safe.

# How we built it

We built our app using Rust, along with various libraries within Rust. These libraries are SQLX, Windows API and many more!

# Challenges we ran into

* Implementing different functions
* Implementation of SQL
* Connecting the front end of the app to the back-end code

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

* Learning rust in a fast and challenging environment well
* The amount of team work we both put in
* The time we spent on this project
* How much fun we had while working on this competition

# What we learned

* How to program in Rust
* Git and GitHub

# What's next?

We plan to continue working to improve this project, and make it so that it becomes usable in the future. Our goal is to make it so, people all over the world can have an easily open source based program to manage their device settings with.
